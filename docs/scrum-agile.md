## Requirements for a user story to be considered DONE (DoD)
For a User Story to be considered as DONE, all the following need to be met:
<ol>
<li>A pull request has been made, reviewed and merged into Main.</li>
<li>Any pull request that affects other teams' implementations needs to be reviewed by at least 1 member of each affected team.</li>
<li>Implementations that require testing need 90% of Jacoco coverage.</li>
<li>Merging does not cause any tests to fail.</li>
<li>None of the previously implemented features ceased working unexpectedly.</li>
<li>All the user acceptance criteria for the story are met.</li>
</ol>

## Project Structure

- The teams will self-name and come up with a four-letter acronym. The acronym will be called your TEAMTAG in these instructions.
- Each team is responsible for one or more microservices.
- Each team is responsible for implementing the UI for their features.
